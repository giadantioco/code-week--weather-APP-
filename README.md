  - Dynamic background: the background changes based on the time of the day <br>
  - City selection: choose a city from a dropdown menu (just for cities in Milan county state) <br>
  - City selection: chhose a city from anywhere in the world form the input menu (be careful, time will not work!) <br>
  - Geolocation: fetch weather based on your location <br>

  Iteresting Facts <br>
  I started by thinking the logic of the app and I developed the display only after: such a mistake! I did not know how much logic I could have added and I had no clue about the style yet. <br>
  I still would like to implement the filtered search by adding the API with altitude, longitude and country code because I runned out of time [go to openweater API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) <br>
  My script.js file is very messy, sorry. <br>
  The thing I troubled the most with has been CSS media queries of search button (the gray one with the magnifier) <br> 
  The day before the deadline I didn't realise I had internet down and I thounght I broke the app :joy:

<p>Thankyou for watching. Please feel free to fork the repo and make the changes you'd like! </p>
